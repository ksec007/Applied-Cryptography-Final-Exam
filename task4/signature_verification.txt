S/MIME Email Signature and Encryption Verification Summary

    Alice composed a plain text message (original_message.txt).

    She digitally signed the message using her private key (alice_private.key) to provide proof of authenticity and prevent repudiation.

    Alice then encrypted the signed message using Bob's public certificate (bob_cert.pem), ensuring the message remains confidential during transmission.

    Bob decrypted the message using his corresponding private key (bob_private.key).

    To confirm the source and integrity, Bob verified the digital signature using Aliceâ€™s public certificate (alice_cert.pem).

Outcome:

    The successful signature verification proves that Alice was the true sender, and the message was not modified in transit.

    The decrypted message exactly matches the original, validating both authenticity and integrity.
